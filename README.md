# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This project aims to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. The application will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## Installation

This application runs in a browser while its HTML, CSS, JS, images, and README files are accessed through the author's GitHub repository at https://github.com/gocrushgoals/work-day-schedule

## Usage

This application enables an employee (user) with a busy schedule to add important events so the user can manage the user's time effectively.

* When the user opens the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. The application uses a date utility library to work with date and time;

* When the user scrolls down, the user is presented with time-blocks for standard business hours of 9 AM to 5 PM;

* When the user views the time-blocks for that day, each time-block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. Past even is in gray, present is in red, and future is in green;

* When the user clicks into a time-block, the user can enter an event;

* When the user clicks the save button for that time-block, the text for that event is saved in local storage;

* When the user refreshes the page, the saved events persist.

* The time-block entry fields are editable, however, the user can use the clear button to clear all contents and the local storage.
